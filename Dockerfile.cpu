# Install code we want, in a script so we can delete unneeded files and not have
# them end up in the Docker image. Because it's one script the Docker builds
# will be fairly slow, since they can't rely on caching. If the build slowness
# ever becomes an issue we can switch to multi-stage builds, but it's probably
# not worth it at this point since the code doesn't change that often.
